        "The history of the Royal Palace in the Buda Castle, which was at that time recognised as a magnificent royal residence in Europe, dates back to the 14th century, the reign of kings Louis the Great, Sigismund, and Matthias Corvinus (1458–1490). The state of the building badly deteriorated during the Turkish occupation starting in 1541, and during the Battle of Buda in 1686. The restoration, in the then fashionable Baroque style, began during the reign of Queen Maria Theresa in 1749. "

        "\n\n  At the end of the 19th century the palace was expanded with another wing according to the plans of architects Miklós Ybl and Alajos Hauszmann, and later neo-Baroque ornamentation was also added. During World War II the building was again severely damaged; its reconstruction began in the 1960s. The Hungarian National Gallery moved to the Royal Palace of Buda Castle in 1975."

        "\n\n The Hungarian National Gallery is the largest public collection documenting and presenting the rise and development of the fine arts in Hungary. It has operated as an independent institution since 1957. The HNG moved to its present location, the former Royal Palace of Buda, in 1975."

        "\n\n The Buda Palace with its characteristic Dome, easily recognizable even from afar is one of the symbols of Budapest. As the highest point of the Palace, the Dome of the Hungarian National Gallery offers an unparalleled view on the capital."

        "\n\n The family crypt in Buda Castle holding the earthly remains of Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary, his family members and descendants, is the only part of the Hungarian National Gallery that still preserves something of the palace’s original, 19th-century beauty. The crypt was part of and located under the Saint Sigismund chapel, which was demolished in 1961. From the 1790s the palace became the residence of the palatine, i.e. the prevailing Hungarian representative of the king. Archduke Joseph, a brother of King Francis I, held the title of palatine between 1795 and 1847 and, with royal consent, was the first to have the crypts of the castle chapel converted into a family burial place. After the death of the palatine and his widow their son, Joseph Karl, commissioned two architects, first Miklós Ybl and later Alajos Hausmann, to reconstruct the crypt, while the sculptor, György Zala, was entrusted with making the palatine’s sepulchre."

        "Ever since its establishment at the end of the 19th century, Kunsthalle has been the centre of contemporary Hungarian fine art, and a key institution in canon-formation. It is a national institution with the mission of exhibiting the most significant trends of both contemporary Hungarian and international fine art in Budapest."

        "\n\n The art centre at Heroes’ Square in Budapest is open to the whole spectrum of Hungarian visual culture. It operates strictly according to the principle of aesthetic value, without any constraint of ideology or age. Besides organising exhibitions, programs involving other art forms, and academic conferences, Kunsthalle’s publishing activity is significant as well."

        "\n\n The Műcsarnok (“art hall”) was founded in 1877 on the initiative of the Hungarian National Fine Arts Association. The original building was situated at 69–71 Andrássy Street, now home to the University of Fine Arts. The exhibition hall on Heroes’ Square was erected in 1896 for the millennium celebrations, and was designed by Albert Schikedanz. Today the hall operates on the pattern of the German Kunsthalle: it is an institution run by artists that does not maintain its own collection. The three-bayed, semi-circular apse houses a roofed exhibition hall that allows in light through the roof. Since the building was renovated in 1995 the Műcsarnok has welcomed visitors and leading Hungarian and international contemporary artists alike, mediating and representing modern artistic tendencies whilst not maintaining its own permanent collection."

        "Mai Manó, Imperial and Royal Court Photographer (1855-1917) had his eight-story studio-house and home built in fourteen months in 1893-94."

        "\n\n A professional photographer and specialist, in his time he was one of the best specialists of child portraits. His status in the professional community of that time is uncontested. He was also the founder and editor of the periodical called A Fény (The Light, launched in 1906) The building’s richly decorated neo-renaissance façade clearly served ideological purposes: Mai Manó wanted to lend a past to the young trade, hardly considered to be a form of art by anyone at that time. Take the majolica putti between the ground floor and the mezzanine or the façade paintings on the third floor showing the “six muses of photography”."

        "\n\n Actual photographing took place in the Sunlight-studio on the second floor, we restored in 1996-97. During the restoration, we found the original frescoes hiding bethind the white wallpaper for decades. These used to serve as background for Mai’s portraits. His studio worked in the house for four decades, until 1931. It was followed by a luxury-bar, Arizona, which was closed in 1944."

        "\n\n After the Second World War, a number of institutions and companies moved into the house and a few private apartments were separated as well. In spite of all the vicissitudes, the house kept its original character. It was declared a piece of national heritage in 1996 considering its special architecture, ornaments and industry-historical significance. While the idea to turn the House into a centre of photography resurfaced countless times throughout the decades, the plan’s realization waited for the perseverance and hard work of three zealous persons: Magdolna Kolta, Károly Kincses, and András Bánkuti. Hungarian House of Photography, or as its friends call it, Mai Manó House open since November, 1998. The reconstruction of the building – has been sponsored by the Hungarian State and planned by Szántó and Mikó Architects – is not far from completion."

        "\n\n Mai Manó House presents its exhibitions on three floors."

        "\n\n On the mezzanine, in Kis Manó Gallery – in the bookshop – we organize small-scale exhibitions, sometimes from the works of debutant photographers."

        "\n\n In the four rooms interconnected on the first floor, we organize thematic shows, group-presentations, retrospective exhibitions of classic masters from home and abroad."

        "\n\n On the second floor, in the rooms next to Mai Manó’s Sunlight studio, the retrospective exhibitions may continue or we present a coherent series of photographs."

        "\n\n Our choices are based on quality, not style, which results in a miscellaneous variety of exhibitions, and a colourful overview of the field of photography. We focus on contemporary, sometimes classic works of art."

        "\n\n The aim of Mai Manó House is to advance the development of Hungarian photography and raise photography’s national prestige as a distinct form of art."

        "Ludwig Museum - Museum of Contemporary Art collects and displays masterworks of modern and contemporary art."

        "\n\n Its collection contains valuable pieces of American pop art (Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Robert Rauschenberg etc.). Yet focusing on Eastern and Central European art, it also puts a special emphasis on presenting the Hungarian art of the 60's to recent days in an international context. Besides, temporary exhibitions showcase leading artists of the international scene as well as the best-known Hungarian masters. Be sure to explore the Museum's colourful place which is indeed a contemporary work of art as well."

        "\n\n The German couple, Irene and Peter Ludwig, the founders of Ludwig Museum – Museum of Contemporary Art, Budapest, built up a collection of more than 12 thousand works of art, ranging from antiquities to contemporary art. The pieces they have donated or lent are on display at 30 museums worldwide, out of which 12 bears the name of the founders, among others institutions in Budapest, Cologne, Vienna and Beijing."

        "\n\n Ludwig Museum, Budapest – the first Ludwig institution beyond the Iron Curtain – was founded in 1989, which was preceded by the formation of Ludwig Foundation in Hungary in 1987."

        "\n\n Ludwig Museum is located inside the Palace of Arts (Művészetek Palotája) aka. MÜPA. The Museum's three floors are in the west wing of the building ensuring a spectacular view from the exhibition halls and the balcony and terrace. "

        "\n\n The Ludwig Museum’s collection building, exhibitions and events aim at enabling a wider public to form a closer acquaintance with contemporary art, as well as the preservation of its values. Professional activities are performed by specifically qualified colleagues. We make regular re-assessment of our goals and achievements and we are open to changes if the need arises. We provide continuous dialogue between past and present, between mainstream art and experimental artistic initiations.
"
        "\n\n The Museum functions as a public space open to the widest possible public. Following the principle of inclusivity the Museum is continually working on providing ever better conditions of access to its collection and events. We strive to conduct our daily work in an economically and environmentally sustainable form."

        "The Museum of Fine Arts, opened in 1906, is reputed to be among Europe’s most prominent museums. Its multi-faceted collections and their historical continuity coupled with the large number of masterpieces undoubtedly earn it a prestigious place among public collections. The Museum of Fine Arts displays the treasures of international and Hungarian art spanning from ancient times to the end of the eighteenth century, while its large-scale temporary exhibitions attract hundreds of thousands of visitors."

        "\n\n After the most comprehensive reconstruction project in its history, the museum re-opened at the end of 2018. Thanks to the modernisation, the Museum of Fine Arts now satisfies twenty-first-century requirements for collection care and visitor engagement. "

        "\n\n Parallel to the reconstruction, the permanent exhibitions were also renewed: the collection of Hungarian art before 1800 – which was separated from international art in two stages after 1957 and transferred to the Hungarian National Gallery – “came home” after a long period of absence. As a result, returning to its original concept, introduced at the time of its opening in 1906, the museum is again operating as an exhibition venue presenting Hungarian and international art history to the public. Besides showcasing ancient cultures thanks to its collections of Egyptian and classical antiquities, the museum has also become home to artworks from before 1800. Until the opening of the New National Gallery in the City Park, whose building was designed by the Pritzker Prize-winning SAANA architectural firm, works of art from the period after the beginning of the nineteenth century can be viewed in the Hungarian National Gallery in Buda Castle."

        "\n\n World War I and the following austerities broke the museum’s spectacular development, although important works entered the collections even in the interwar period. However, World War II shook the Museum of Fine Arts to its very core, dealing severe blows and causing great damage to the institution. The upper staircase was hit by a bomb and the glass roof was completely destroyed. In the last months of the war, the majority of the artworks, including the most valuable masterpieces, were hurriedly and carelessly thrown on rail cars and transported to the west. The collection returned to Hungary from Germany between 1946 and 1947, damaged to a great extent. A smaller proportion of the paintings went missing or were destroyed during rescue efforts and war operations, and have been listed among the war losses to this day."

        "\n\n The Hungarian works were separated from the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts after 1957 and were transferred to the Hungarian National Gallery. The two institutions were reunited in 2012 and the Hungarian works from the period before 1800 returned home to the renovated building of the Museum of Fine Arts in 2018."

        "\n\n During its centuries of history, the number of works in some of the Museum of Fine Arts’ collections increased manifold; moreover, new departments were added. The number of artworks found in the museum today exceeds 120 thousand."

        "The Petőfi Literary Museum was established in 1954. As the legal successor of Petőfi House, which operated as an exhibition and research centre between 1909 and 1945, the newly founded museum inherited a considerable collection."

        "\n\n The founding of Petőfi House in 1909 was encouraged not only by the institutionalization of the Petőfi cult, but also the realisation that at the time writers’ documents, although part of the national heritage, were not included in the collections of libraries, museums and archives. Alongside the undertaking to preserve the valuable documents launched by the Petőfi Society, the activity of Petőfi House not only included the collection of Petőfi manuscripts, books and relics available at that time, but also the purchase of the house on Bajza Street, which was owned jointly by Mór Jókai and his son-in-law, Árpád Feszty. Thus Petőfi House began keeping and conserving Jókai relics and maintaining his cult."

        "\n\n The task of the new, national museum was not only to process the inherited estates in an up-to-date manner, but also to persistently collect valuable items of contemporary Hungarian literature. Thus the Literary Museum’s scale of collecting became rather broad. It extended to literature written in Hungarian in Hungary and across the country’s borders, correspondence and collections of writers’ libraries, objects and artworks with a literary theme, as well as sound recordings. Later the collection of emigré newspapers, books and manuscripts was established and expanded."

        "\n\n Right from the time of its establishment, the museum’s tasks included mentoring literary collections and exhibitions in the provinces. The PLM has become an institution of literary museology with nationwide authority, which not only assists staging exhibitions in provincial memorial houses and rooms, but also has contacts with Hungarian literary memorial sights abroad. In 2008, the Association of Hungarian Literary Memorial Houses was established on the initiative of the Petőfi Literary Museum in the spirit of professional cooperation."

        "\n\n From December 1998 the literary museum, again bearing Petőfi’s name, became a part of the Károlyi Mansion Cultural Centre after the cessation of the Centre of Contemporary Literature in 2000. In 2003 the Petőfi Literary Museum was given a new organisational structure, which was extended with the Béla Hamvas Culture Research Institute in the same year. Then the PLM was joined by the Academy of Digital Literature in 2007, the Hungarian Books and Translations Office in 2012, the Museum of Hungarian Language and the Ferenc Kazinczy Museum in 2013."
